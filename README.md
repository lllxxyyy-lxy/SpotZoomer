# VISD

**VISD: Inferring High-Resolution Spatial Transcriptomics Across Platforms Using Cross-Sample Transfer Learning**

VISD is a deep generative model designed to enhance the spatial resolution of Visium data by transferring knowledge from high-resolution spatial transcriptomics platforms.

## 📁 Data

All datasets used in VISD can be downloaded from the 10x Genomics data repository:

### 📥 Required Input Format for Training

The following files are required as input for training:

- `re_image.tif` — Raw histology image.
- `pseudo_st.csv` — Gene count matrix.
  - Row 1: Gene names.
  - Row 2 onward: One row per spot.
    - Column 1: Spot ID
    - Column 2 and onward: Gene expression values
- `pseudo_locs.csv` — Spot coordinates.
  - Row 1: Header
  - Row 2 onward: One row per spot, matching `pseudo_st.csv`
    - Column 1: Spot ID  
    - Column 2: x-coordinate (horizontal, matches column index of `re_image.tif`)  
    - Column 3: y-coordinate (vertical, matches row index of `re_image.tif`)
- `mask.png` — Tissue segmentation mask indicating valid sequencing area.
- `gene_names.txt` — List of gene names.
- `pixel-size-raw.txt` — Physical pixel size (in micrometers) in `re_image.tif`. Typically between 0.1 and 1.0.
- `radius-raw.txt` — Spot radius in number of pixels in `re_image.tif`.

### 🧼 Data Preprocessing

We provide detailed tutorials to help you preprocess datasets from different platforms. These tutorials can also be adapted for your own data.

- 📘 [Tutorial1-HD processing.ipynb](Tutorial1-HD%20processing.ipynb): Preprocessing for Visium HD data  
- 📘 [Tutorial2-Xenium processing.ipynb](Tutorial2-Xenium%20processing.ipynb): Preprocessing for Xenium data  
- ✅ **For Visium:** No special preprocessing is required. You can directly use `pseudo_st.csv` and `pseudo_locs.csv` as the expression matrix and spatial coordinates.

## 🚀 Demo: Training VISD and Predicting High-Resolution Gene Expression (Mouse Brain)

Due to its large size, the demo dataset is hosted on Zenodo:  
📦 [Download from Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/12800375)

After downloading, place the files in the project's `data/` directory.

A complete tutorial is available that walks you through training VISD and visualizing the predicted high-resolution gene expression:
